# Nmap Scan Types: Balancing Stealth and Logging Considerations

**Introduction:**
Nmap is a tool for scanning networks, and it offers different scanning options. When choosing between `-sT` and `-sS`, it's about finding a balance between staying hidden and leaving traces. This explanation aims to help understand the main differences, especially in terms of logging.

**1. Nmap Scan with -sT:**
   - The `-sT` option uses a method called TCP connect scan, which completes a full connection. This gives a good overview of open ports and services, but it also leaves a mark in the target's logs. Websites, firewalls, or monitoring devices can log the IP address conducting the scan.

**2. Nmap Scan with -sS:**
   - On the other hand, the `-sS` option uses a SYN scan, a stealthier method that avoids completing the full connection. While this doesn't get logged, it does expose the source IP address. Monitoring devices, like firewalls or IDS, can still detect the scan.

**Considerations:**
   - The choice between `-sT` and `-sS` involves a trade-off between getting more information and reducing the chances of being logged. While `-sS` avoids logging the scan activity, it doesn't make you completely invisible. The decision depends on the specific goals and constraints of the scanning situation.

**Conclusion:**
   - In using Nmap scans, understanding the differences between `-sT` and `-sS` is important. The decision between these scan types should be based on knowing the trade-offs between visibility and logging. While `-sS` helps avoid logging, it doesn't guarantee complete invisibility. Choose the scan type that aligns with your specific objectives and limitations.

example:
```bash
sudo nmap -sT -A 192.168.1.101

sudo nmap -sS -A 192.168.1.101
