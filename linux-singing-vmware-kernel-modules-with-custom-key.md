# Signing VMware Kernel Modules on Linux with Custom Key and Certificate

This guide outlines the steps to sign VMware kernel modules on a Linux system using a custom key and certificate. This process is especially useful when dealing with Secure Boot. The example provided is tailored for VMware version 17.

## Resolving VMware Kernel Module Issues on Linux and Fixing Virtual Machine Startup Errors

If you encounter the error messages below while starting a VMware virtual machine:

**Errors:**

- Could not open /dev/vmmon: No such file or directory.
Please make sure that the kernel module 'vmmon' is loaded.

- Failed to initialize monitor device.

- Unable to change virtual machine power state: Transport (VMDB) error -14: Pipe connection has been broken.

This guide outlines the steps to sign VMware kernel modules on a Linux system using a custom key and certificate. This process is especially useful when dealing with Secure Boot and can resolve issues related to missing or incorrectly loaded `vmmon` kernel modules.

## Steps:

1. **Install VMware:**
   Ensure that VMware is installed on your system.

2. **Generate Key and Certificate for VMware 17:**
   Use the following command to generate a new key and certificate pair for VMware 17. Adjust the filenames and subject information as needed.

   ```bash
   openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout VMWARE17.priv -outform DER -out VMWARE17.der -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=VMWARE17/"
    ```
   
3. **Sign VMware Kernel Modules:**
   Sign the VMware kernel modules with the generated key and certificate.
   ```bash
   sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE17.priv ./VMWARE17.der $(modinfo -n vmmon)
   sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 ./VMWARE17.priv ./VMWARE17.der $(modinfo -n vmnet)
   ```
   
   Ensure that the filenames (VMWARE17.priv and VMWARE17.der) match the names you used in the key generation step.

4. **Verify Module Signature:**
   Verify that the module signatures have been appended.
   ```bash
   tail $(modinfo -n vmmon) | grep "Module signature appended"
   tail $(modinfo -n vmnet) | grep "Module signature appended"
   ```
   
5. **Import Certificate into MOK (Machine Owner Key):**
   Import the certificate into the MOK (Machine Owner Key) to ensure it's recognized during the boot process.
   ```bash
   sudo mokutil --import VMWARE17.der
   ```
   
6. **Reboot:**
   Reboot your system.

7. **Test the Imported Key:**
   After the reboot, you can test whether the key was successfully imported.
   ```bash
   mokutil --test-key VMWARE17.der
   ```
This process should resolve the specified error messages and ensure proper initialization of VMware virtual machines.
